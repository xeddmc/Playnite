I have verified that:
- [ ] These changes work, by building the application and testing them.
- [ ] Pull request is targeting `devel` branch.
- [ ] I added myself into [contributors file](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/blob/devel/source/Playnite.DesktopApp/Resources/contributors.txt) if I want to receive contribution credit in the application itself.
